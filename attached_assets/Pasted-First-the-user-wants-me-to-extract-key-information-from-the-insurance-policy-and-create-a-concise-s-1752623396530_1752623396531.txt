First, the user wants me to extract key information from the insurance policy and create a concise summary. I must use ACTUAL data from the document. Specifically, look for names, amounts, dates, and policy numbers.

The format should be EXACTLY as shown:

Your Coverage Summary
Then, write ONE paragraph (100-150 words) summarizing the policy. It should include:

- Insurance company name

- Business name if mentioned

- Main coverage types with dollar amounts

- A practical example of coverage

Start with "This is a..."

Additionally, after the paragraph, I need to include these specific points:

- Coverage Period: [Extract exact dates]

- Policy Number: [Extract actual policy number]

- Primary Coverage: [Extract main coverage and amount]

- Deductible: [Find specific deductible amount]

- Key Exclusion: [Extract one main exclusion in simple terms]

Finally, end with: Contact Valley Trust: (540) 885-5531

From the document, let's extract the key data:

- Insurance company name: Erie Insurance Company

- Business name: MOR JEN HEATH, INC DBA DEPOT GRILLE

- Coverage Period: 05 10 2025 to 05 10 2026 (which is May 10, 2025 to May 10, 2026)

- Policy Number: Q61 0413185

- Primary Coverage: From the document, Commercial General Liability: Bodily injury and property damage $1,000,000 Each occurrence; General aggregate $2,000,000; etc. So, main one is General Liability: $1,000,000 per occurrence.

- Deductible: For liability, it's mentioned as CG0305 01 96 Deductible Liability Insurance, and in property, it's $1,000 for property deductible.

Specifically, under Liability Protection: It says "Coverage Deductible Limit Bodily injury and property damage 1,000,000 Each occurrence" – wait, that might be the limit, not deductible. Actually, looking closely: In the forms, there's CG0305 for Deductible Liability Insurance, but in the main text, for property, it's $1,000. For liability, it might be included. Wait, in Page 2: "Commercial general liability coverage Coverage Deductible Limit" – it lists "Bodily injury and property damage 1,000,000 Each occurrence" but doesn't specify a deductible
