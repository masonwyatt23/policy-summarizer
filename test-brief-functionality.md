# Brief Toggle Test Plan

## Current Issue
User reports that when the toggle is set to "brief", the system still produces 5-paragraph output instead of the expected single-paragraph summary.

## Expected Behavior
- **Normal Mode**: 5-paragraph comprehensive analysis (current default)
- **Brief Mode**: Single comprehensive paragraph with 400-600 words

## Test Steps to Verify Fix

1. **Navigate to PolicySummaryGenerator**
2. **Toggle to Brief Mode** (should show "Brief" description)
3. **Upload a test document** (use one of the PDF files in attached_assets)
4. **Check console logs** for debugging information:
   - Should show "Summary type: brief" 
   - Should show "Brief mode active: true"
5. **Verify output** is a single paragraph with subheader [Executive Policy Analysis]

## Debugging Added
- DocumentProcessor now logs: "Summary type: {summaryType}"
- DocumentProcessor now logs: "Passing summaryType '{summaryType}' to xAI service"
- xAI service now logs: "Using {summaryType} format"
- xAI service now logs: "Brief mode active: {true/false}"

## Code Changes Made
1. Updated DocumentProcessor to accept summaryType parameter
2. Updated xAI service to use conditional prompts based on summaryType
3. Added comprehensive debugging throughout the pipeline
4. Brief prompt configured to generate single paragraph with [Executive Policy Analysis] subheader

## Next Steps
1. Test the brief toggle with a real document upload
2. Verify console logs show correct summaryType parameter passing
3. Confirm output is single paragraph format
4. If still not working, investigate further debugging points
