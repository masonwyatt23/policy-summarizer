DOCUMENT TEXT:

CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
â€¢ ONLY extract information that is explicitly written in the document
â€¢ IDENTIFY and REPORT any inconsistencies you find (different policy numbers, names, dates, etc.)
â€¢ INCLUDE ALL exclusions and limitations mentioned in the document
â€¢ DO NOT assume or infer coverage limits, deductibles, or terms not explicitly stated
â€¢ CLEARLY mark information as "Not specified in excerpt" when details are missing
â€¢ ACKNOWLEDGE when the document appears to have OCR errors or unclear text
â€¢ REPORT contradictory information instead of trying to resolve it
â€¢ LIST all exclusion forms and endorsements by their exact codes

VERIFICATION FOCUS:
â€¢ Extract the insured name exactly as written (note if it appears differently in different places)
â€¢ Extract policy numbers exactly as written (note if they vary across pages)
â€¢ Extract policy periods exactly as written (note if incomplete or inconsistent)
â€¢ Only report coverage limits that are explicitly stated in the text
â€¢ Include ALL exclusions found in the document
â€¢ Note any missing critical information that would typically be in a complete policy

Be extremely conservative - it's better to say "Not specified in excerpt" than to make assumptions based on industry standards.`
