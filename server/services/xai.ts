CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
‚Ä¢ ONLY report information that is explicitly stated in the document
‚Ä¢ NEVER make assumptions or fill in missing details
‚Ä¢ ACKNOWLEDGE inconsistencies and discrepancies in the document
‚Ä¢ CLEARLY indicate when information is missing or unclear
‚Ä¢ INCLUDE ALL exclusions and limitations found in the document
‚Ä¢ IDENTIFY and NOTE any contradictory information
‚Ä¢ EXPLICITLY STATE when details cannot be verified from the provided text

DOCUMENT ANALYSIS APPROACH:
‚Ä¢ Extract ONLY what is explicitly written in the document
‚Ä¢ Note inconsistencies in names, numbers, dates, or terms
‚Ä¢ Include ALL exclusions and limitations mentioned
‚Ä¢ Identify coverage forms and endorsements by their exact codes
‚Ä¢ Report contact information ONLY if clearly stated
‚Ä¢ Acknowledge incomplete or unclear information
‚Ä¢ Do not assume standard policy terms or industry defaults

ACCURACY STANDARDS:
‚Ä¢ Use ONLY information that appears verbatim in the document
‚Ä¢ Flag any inconsistencies or unclear information
‚Ä¢ Include exclusions as prominently as coverage details
‚Ä¢ Clearly distinguish between verified facts and unclear information
‚Ä¢ Never extrapolate beyond what is explicitly stated

DOCUMENT TEXT:

CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
‚Ä¢ ONLY extract information that is explicitly written in the document
‚Ä¢ IDENTIFY and REPORT any inconsistencies you find (different policy numbers, names, dates, etc.)
‚Ä¢ INCLUDE ALL exclusions and limitations mentioned in the document
‚Ä¢ DO NOT assume or infer coverage limits, deductibles, or terms not explicitly stated
‚Ä¢ CLEARLY mark information as "Not specified in excerpt" when details are missing
‚Ä¢ ACKNOWLEDGE when the document appears to have OCR errors or unclear text
‚Ä¢ REPORT contradictory information instead of trying to resolve it
‚Ä¢ LIST all exclusion forms and endorsements by their exact codes

VERIFICATION FOCUS:
‚Ä¢ Extract the insured name exactly as written (note if it appears differently in different places)
‚Ä¢ Extract policy numbers exactly as written (note if they vary across pages)
‚Ä¢ Extract policy periods exactly as written (note if incomplete or inconsistent)
‚Ä¢ Only report coverage limits that are explicitly stated in the text
‚Ä¢ Include ALL exclusions found in the document
‚Ä¢ Note any missing critical information that would typically be in a complete policy

Be extremely conservative - it's better to say "Not specified in excerpt" than to make assumptions based on industry standards.`
