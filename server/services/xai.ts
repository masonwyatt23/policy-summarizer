DOCUMENT TEXT:
${documentText}

CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:
• ONLY extract information that is explicitly written in the document
• IDENTIFY and REPORT any inconsistencies you find (different policy numbers, names, dates, etc.)
• INCLUDE ALL exclusions and limitations mentioned in the document
• DO NOT assume or infer coverage limits, deductibles, or terms not explicitly stated
• CLEARLY mark information as "Not specified in excerpt" when details are missing
• ACKNOWLEDGE when the document appears to have OCR errors or unclear text
• REPORT contradictory information instead of trying to resolve it
• LIST all exclusion forms and endorsements by their exact codes

VERIFICATION FOCUS:
• Extract the insured name exactly as written (note if it appears differently in different places)
• Extract policy numbers exactly as written (note if they vary across pages)
• Extract policy periods exactly as written (note if incomplete or inconsistent)
• Only report coverage limits that are explicitly stated in the text
• Include ALL exclusions found in the document
• Note any missing critical information that would typically be in a complete policy

Be extremely conservative - it's better to say "Not specified in excerpt" than to make assumptions based on industry standards.`
