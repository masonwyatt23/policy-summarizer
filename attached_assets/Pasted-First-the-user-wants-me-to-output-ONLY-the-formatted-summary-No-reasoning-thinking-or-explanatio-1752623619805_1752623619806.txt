First, the user wants me to output ONLY the formatted summary. No reasoning, thinking, or explanations. So, my response should be just the summary as specified.

The format is:

Your Coverage Summary
Then, a one-paragraph summary (100-150 words) starting with "This is a..."

Followed by bullet points:

•
Coverage Period: [Extract exact dates]
•
Policy Number: [Extract actual policy number]
•
Primary Coverage: [Extract main coverage and amount]
•
Deductible: [Extract deductible amount]
•
Key Exclusion: [Extract one main exclusion]
And end with: Contact Valley Trust: (540) 885-5531

From the policy text, I need to extract the relevant information.

1.

Insurance Company Name:
It's Erie Insurance Company.

2.

Business Name:
The insured is MOR JEN HEATH, INC DBA DEPOT GRILLE.

3.

Main Coverage Types with Dollar Amounts:
From the text:

- Commercial General Liability: Bodily injury and property damage $1,000,000 each occurrence.

- Other coverages like Personal and advertising injury $1,000,000, etc.

For the summary paragraph, I need to include main ones and a practical example.

4.

Coverage Period:
Policy period: 05 10 2025 to 05 10 2026. So, May 10, 2025, to May 10, 2026.

5.

Policy Number:
Q61 0413185

6.

Primary Coverage:
Main one is Commercial General Liability with $1,000,000 for bodily injury and property damage.

7.

Deductible:
For Liability, it's $1,000 for Bodily injury and property damage. Also, for Property, it's $1,000.

I need to extract one, probably the liability deductible.

8.

Key Exclusion:
From the text, there's "Exclusion - Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)", "Abuse or molestation exclusion", etc. I can pick one, say PFAS exclusion.

Now, for the paragraph: Write ONE paragraph (100-150 words) summarizing this policy. Include: insurance company name, business name if mentioned, main coverage types with dollar amounts, and a practical example of coverage. Start with "This is a..."

So, something like: "This is a policy from Erie Insurance Company for MOR JEN HEATH, INC
